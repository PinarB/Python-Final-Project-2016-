How to use
----------
1) Double-click or otherwise start the python program.
2) Enter the name (excluding extension) of the text file containing the data you wish to analyze.
	-> This file must be in the same directory as the python program file.
3) If you want the results to be written to a file, enter the file name (excluding extension) of this file.


Troubleshooting
---------------
Possible causes of errors:

- The file type is not .txt. The input must be a text file.
- The file is blank or not in the same location as the python program file. Please place your data file in the same folder as the program.
- The file is not the right type of data. The input must be comma-separated values.
- The data does not include a "Wage" or "Age" category. If you have these categories, please check that they are spelled correctly in this manner.
